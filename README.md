## Logging Events
Each log is sent with a number of fields required by [simplelog](https://github.com/fielddaylab/simplelog). Simple log allows for a custom field called event_data_complex along with its category enumerator:
  event_custom: category enumerator
  event_data_complex: JSON.stringify(log_data)
Each log_data is a JSON object for that specific category as defined below.
Note: Note: event_custom will always map to a string of the event name. For example, if an event called FOO had a field of "event_custom", its value would be a string "FOO". Not all events have this field.

## Survey
Survey questions are listed below, where each question is mapped to an index:
    0: 'What grade are you in?',
    1: 'How well do you read in English?',
    2: 'The game grabs my attention.',
    3: 'I like watching TV shows about history.',
    4: 'Jo is friendly.',
    5: 'I think the characters are funny.',
    6: 'The characters say things that make me laugh.',
    7: 'Time flies while I\'m playing the game.',
    8: 'I like reading about history.',
    9: 'I like Jo.',
    10: 'Jo is kind.',
    11: 'The characters say funny things.',
    12: 'I forget what\'s around me while playing the game.',
    13: 'I like learning history very much.',
    14: 'I think learning history is fun.',
    15: 'I can relate to Jo.',
    16: 'The characters are entertaining.',
    17: 'I feel emotionally involved in the game.'

#### Change Log
Versions:
1. Original
2. Restructured to flatten logging objects (which originally contained many sub-objects)

4. Change name, type, and subtype to representitive strings instead of numbers (11/12/2019)
5. Intermediate Change. (11/26/2019)
6. Big Change. Will update readme later with all that has been changed (11/26/2019).

8. Add "quiz_number" to [quiz](#quiz) (7/23/2020). Quiz questions subject to change, but now there is a quiz after each chapter end.
9. Add [quizquestion](#quizquestion) log (#22) (7/29/2020).
9. Add [quizstart](#quizstart) and [quizend](#quizend) logs (#23,#24) (8/03/2020).

<a name="script_types"/>

#### Script Types
Starting in v7, multiple scripts were added to the game for AB tests on snark and humor. The game will randomly choose between 4 different data files: data_dry.js, data_nohumor.js, data_nosnark.js, and the original data.js. They are each built from their respective data folder in assets. The type of script used is only logged once, in [startgame](#startgame).

| Index | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|0 | dry  | no humor or snark |
|1 | nohumor  |no humor (includes snark) |
|2 | nosnark  | no snark (includes humor). No snark can also be thought of as "obedient" |
|3 | normal | base script (includes snark and humor) |

<a name="script_versions"/>

#### Script Versions
Starting in v7. The version of script used is only logged once, in [startgame](#startgame). Different script types may have different versions, but for now they are all uniform.

| Version | Description |
| --- | --- |
|0 | Base game, all script types were the same as the original script (type 3: normal).  |
|1 | Changed the script for Chapter 1 to reflect the different types. Type 3 stays the same. |
|2 | Updated survey questions (8/26/2020). |
|3 | Changed the script of rest of chapters to reflect the different types (10/8/2020). |

<a name="GeneratingScripts"/>

### Generating Scripts

#### Configuring the Script Generator File
In `/engine`, edit the first few lines of `gen_data.sh` based on the script you want to edit:
1. original (data)
```
ENGINE_DD=../assets/data
GAME_DD=assets/data
STUB_D=stubs
OUT=data.js
```
2. no humor (nohumor)
```
ENGINE_DD=../assets/dataNoHumor
GAME_DD=assets/dataNoHumor
STUB_D=stubs
OUT=data_nohumor.js
```
3. no snark (nosnark)
```
ENGINE_DD=../assets/dataNoSnark
GAME_DD=assets/dataNoSnark
STUB_D=stubs
OUT=data_nosnark.js
```
4. no snark and no humor (dry)
```
ENGINE_DD=../assets/dataDry
GAME_DD=assets/dataDry
STUB_D=stubs
OUT=data_dry.js
```

#### Generating Script
1. In terminal, navigate to `/engine`.
1. Run `. quickgen.sh` (Windows users: run `sh quickgen.sh`). If you get an error about `\r` characters, run dos2unix on the erroring file and retry.
1. If generating the `nosnark`, `nohumor`, and `dry` versions, replace the code in `/src/data_nosnark`, `/src/data_nohumor`,  and `/src/data_dry` respectively:
```
tmp_animcycle = new animcycle();
tmp_animcycle.id = "notebook_baked";
tmp_animcycle.fqid = "tunic.notebook_baked";
{
tmp_animcycle.w = 0;
tmp_animcycle.h = 0;
tmp_animcycle.frame_t = 10;
tmp_animcycle.offset_t = 0;
tmp_animcycle.loop = 1;

tmp_animcycle.frame_files = [];
tmp_animcycle.frames = [];
tmp_animcycle.frame_files.push("assets/dataDry/levels/tunic/animcycles/notebook_baked/0.png");
}
tmp_level.animcycles.push(tmp_animcycle);
```
with
```
tmp_animcycle = new animcycle();
tmp_animcycle.id = "notebook_baked_no_monster";
tmp_animcycle.fqid = "tunic.notebook_baked_no_monster";
{
tmp_animcycle.w = 0;
tmp_animcycle.h = 0;
tmp_animcycle.frame_t = 10;
tmp_animcycle.offset_t = 0;
tmp_animcycle.loop = 1;

tmp_animcycle.frame_files = [];
tmp_animcycle.frames = [];
tmp_animcycle.frame_files.push("assets/dataDry/levels/tunic/animcycles/notebook_baked_no_monster/0.png");
}
tmp_level.animcycles.push(tmp_animcycle);
```
if necessary.

4. Optionally, delete any data files generated in the engine folder.
5. If you changed the script, please increment the versions of the script in `/src/log_events.js`, and add a comment of what the version changes. Also add similar documetation to `/README.md` in the `Script Versions` section.
